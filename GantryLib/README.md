# GantryLib

A compatibility and utility library for mods to unlock new capabilities from the engine and make mods work better together. Let me know if you're interested in using this or have requests for capabilities.

Do not reference or use this project directly in your own code. Instead, get the project [GantryLibInterface](../GantryLibInterface). This allows multiple mods to use the same library code and prevents having different versions in different mods.
